## Inspiration
Winnning real cash without spending time watching clips

## What it does
It will automate the task of watching movies and answering quiz.

## How I built it
* AutoIT is an excellent language for such task, so I used that to built the program.
* I needed a webserver to, so I chose 000webhost.com and MySQL database.
* I am also an admin of a facebook group with over 1,000 members to distribute my work for others, free of charge

## Challenges I ran into
* The program runs on my computer but not on others, sometimes was dectected as virus.
* Google drive limits numbers of downloads per day; therefore, the program could not download new version.
* The targeting website changed their API regularly. Everytime they did that, I had to rewrite again.
* My program was decompiled and copied by an individual, and was distributed without my permission.

## Accomplishments that I am proud of
* Being able to share it with others is the best success I achieved when building this program.

## What I learned
* Obfuscated my program to protect intellectual
* Put eveything together, from backend to frontend.
* Documentation is important for others to understand the functionality of the program 

## Built With
